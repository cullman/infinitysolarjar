Here is the parts list that I used at NEWARK.COM  I suggest you get the same parts to assure success and not have compatibility problems.

I use shell solar CIS solar cells that I find on ebay.  The ratings are:
MPP - 3.2v
Open Circuit Voltage - 4.3v
MIA - 100ma
Feel free to use what you can find close to those settings, just don't go over 100ma charging rate or you'll risk blowing the schottky blocking diode and the zener voltage regulator.

You can order the 350F supercapacitor from mouser here:

or if that link doesn't work in the future use mouser's search for:

Ioxus RSC2R7357SR

You can also find 500F supercapacitors on aliexpress.com but you'll have to do some hunting for them.  I'm not going to bother placing a link to them as they periodically change links.
